# Getting Started with Omarchy

## Installation Overview

Omarchy uses an ISO installation method designed for dedicated drives. The installer wipes the selected drive and implements full-disk encryption, making backups essential before proceeding.

## Installation Steps

1. **Download and prepare media**: Obtain the Omarchy ISO and transfer it to a USB stick using balenaEtcher (Mac/Windows) or caligula (Linux).

2. **BIOS configuration**: Many PCs ship with Secure Boot and/or TPM on in the BIOS. You have to turn these off to be able to install Omarchy.

3. **Answer configuration prompts**: Complete setup questions and confirm selections through the installer interface.

4. **Select installation drive**: Choose the target drive for installation. The process takes 2-10 minutes depending on system speed.

## Important Keyboard Requirements

A wired or 2.4GHz wireless keyboard is necessary. The full-disk encryption won't allow you to enter the password from a Bluetooth keyboard at startup.

## Support and Alternatives

- Community assistance available in the #omarchy-help channel on the Omarchy Discord server
- Manual installation option available for special circumstances, including M-Series MacBooks using Asahi Alarm or single-drive dual-booting scenarios

## Dual-Boot Considerations

Standard installation requires two separate disks for dual-booting unless using manual installation methods.

# Welcome to Omarchy

Omarchy is an omakase distribution based on Arch Linux and the Hyprland tiling window manager. The system comes pre-configured with development tools including Neovim, Spotify, Chromium, Typora, Ghostty, and LibreOffice.

## Philosophy

"A _beautiful_ system is a _motivating_ system, and productivity has always been downstream from motivation."

This isn't a bloated collection but rather a curated selection of tools the creator personally uses.

## Approach

This Linux-based approach differs significantly from Windows and macOS. Users are encouraged to embrace terminal-heavy workflows and manual configuration file editing rather than seeking maximum familiarity.

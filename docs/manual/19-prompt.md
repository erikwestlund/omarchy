# Prompt

Omarchy ships with a minimal Starship prompt by default.

The philosophy: "I don't need to know the user, because it's always me, and I don't need to know the time."

## Configuration

Customize your prompt by modifying the Starship configuration file:

```
~/.config/starship.toml
```

Extensive customization possibilities are available through Starship.rs documentation.

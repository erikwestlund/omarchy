# Example vault secrets file
# Copy to secrets.yml and encrypt with: ansible-vault encrypt ansible/vault/secrets.yml
#
# To edit later: ansible-vault edit ansible/vault/secrets.yml
#
# This vault only contains bootstrap credentials to access encrypted secrets in B2.
# Actual secrets (SSH keys, API tokens, etc.) are stored encrypted in B2 and
# pulled to ~/.secrets/ using the secrets-pull script.

# Backblaze B2 credentials
vault_b2_key_id: "your-b2-key-id"
vault_b2_app_key: "your-b2-application-key"
vault_b2_bucket: "your-bucket-name"

# Age encryption key (generate with: age-keygen)
# Store the SECRET KEY here (starts with AGE-SECRET-KEY-)
vault_age_secret_key: "AGE-SECRET-KEY-1XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

# Age public key (for reference, used when encrypting)
# This can be shared/stored in plain text
vault_age_public_key: "age1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

# GitHub credentials (for ghcr.io registry and scripts)
github_username: "your-github-username"
github_pat: "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

# Weather API (Pirate Weather - Dark Sky replacement)
pirate_weather_api_key: "your-pirate-weather-api-key"

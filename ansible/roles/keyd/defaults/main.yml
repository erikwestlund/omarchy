# Mac-like keyboard shortcuts
# These are shared across all keyboard configs

# System-wide shortcuts (applied to all apps)

  meta:
    - { key: a, action: "C-a" }      # Select all
    - { key: f, action: "C-f" }      # Find
  meta_shift: []
    # EMPTY - was blocking Super+Shift+H/J/K/L from reaching Hyprland
    # Super+Shift+H/J/K/L must pass through for window management
  meta_alt:
    - { key: l, action: "C-l" }      # Address bar (browser)

# Browser-only shortcuts (via keyd-application-mapper)
# Note: Multi-modifier combos (like meta+alt) must be in main keyd config,
# not app.conf, since keyd bind doesn't support chained modifiers
keyd_browser_shortcuts:
  - { key: w, action: "C-w" }        # Close tab
  - { key: t, action: "C-t" }        # New tab
  - { key: r, action: "C-r" }        # Refresh
  - { key: q, action: "C-S-w" }      # Close window

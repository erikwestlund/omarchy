# Mac-like keyboard shortcuts
# These are shared across all keyboard configs

# System-wide shortcuts (applied to all apps)
keyd_system_shortcuts:
  meta:
    - { key: a, action: "C-a" }      # Select all
    - { key: f, action: "C-f" }      # Find
    - { key: z, action: "C-z" }      # Undo
    - { key: left, action: "home" }  # Start of line
    - { key: right, action: "end" }  # End of line
    - { key: up, action: "C-home" }  # Top of document
    - { key: down, action: "C-end" } # Bottom of document
  meta_shift:
    - { key: z, action: "C-S-z" }    # Redo
    - { key: left, action: "S-home" }   # Select to start of line
    - { key: right, action: "S-end" }   # Select to end of line
    - { key: up, action: "C-S-home" }   # Select to top of document
    - { key: down, action: "C-S-end" }  # Select to bottom of document
  meta_alt:
    - { key: l, action: "C-l" }      # Address bar (browser)

# Browser-only shortcuts (via keyd-application-mapper)
# Note: Multi-modifier combos (like meta+alt) must be in main keyd config,
# not app.conf, since keyd bind doesn't support chained modifiers
keyd_browser_shortcuts:
  - { key: w, action: "C-w" }        # Close tab
  - { key: t, action: "C-t" }        # New tab
  - { key: r, action: "C-r" }        # Refresh
  - { key: q, action: "C-S-w" }      # Close window
  # z and S-z removed - now in global shortcuts

# This hook runs after any theme is set via Super+Ctrl+Shift+Space
# $1 = theme name (e.g., "rainynight")
#
# Use this for customizations that can't be done via config file overrides.
# Most customizations should go in your config files instead:
#   - ~/.config/hypr/looknfeel.conf (borders, gaps, rounding)
#   - ~/.config/waybar/style.css (fonts, colors after @import)
#   - ~/.config/wofi/style.css (launcher styling)

THEME_NAME="$1"

# Example: notify which theme was applied
# notify-send "Theme changed" "$THEME_NAME"

# Example: restart waybar to ensure CSS changes take effect
# killall -SIGUSR2 waybar

# Add your post-theme customizations below:
